# Presentation and proposal notes
The following are just some scratch notes
## Coding variation is pervasive
There are so many genetic variations but the ones that cause deleterious effects are a very small percentage of that.
And we have limited data for rare gentic variations and their phenotypes.
So one way is we can create an experiment to understand these rare genotypes is by Mutagenesis + DMS
NOTE: Mutagenesis experiments amazing to confirm the phenotypic effects of a genetic variant. But there is so much genetic variation that scalalibility is no hope.
Teh vastness of variation is so big that mutagenesis dont work.
## A motivating problem
1. Avg gene size in human genome 7000base pairs
2. Total variation in each gene
