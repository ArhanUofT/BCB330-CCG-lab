## Functionally characterizing the effects of multiple mutations

Project description

Epistasis, a genetic phenomenon where the effect of a gene mutation depends on the presence or absence of mutations in other genes, serves as a crucial concept in understanding complex biological interactions. Extending this idea to cancer research, our project aims to characterize and quantify the effects of cis multiple mutations—two or more nonsynonymous mutations occurring within the same gene—in the context of cancer. A study has shown that approximately one in four tumors harbor multiple mutations within a cancer-associated gene, highlighting the significance of this phenomenon in tumorigenesis (Gorelick et al. 2020). To characterize these mutations,weI will explore and evaluate existing computational biology tools, including biophysical tools like DDMut and DynaMut2, and evolutionary tools like HMMvar. This evaluation will focus on assessing their efficacy, scalability, and applicability for characterizing cis multiple mutations.We will also experiment with a coevolutionary approach using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) to uncover potential interactions between mutations and how they may contribute to cancer progression. Finally, we will apply these tools to analyze mutations identified in existing literature on multiple mutations in cancer, as well as potentially other datasets, to identify and understand patterns of interest that may provide insights into cancer biology and therapeutic strategies.
